      content:"Use the following six steps to help shift your focus so that you approach exercise as a means to a healthier life, whicAsk anyone who has ever used exercise to make a drastic change to their life and they will likely tell you that consistency is the foundation to long-term success. Yes, we all know that behaviors like regular physical activity and proper nutrition are an essential component of long-term health, but in the hustle and bustle of modern life it can be difficult to make the necessary changes to adopt new lifestyle habits.
      When it comes to exercise, focusing on the positive aspects of changing a behavior can make it a more pleasurable experience. The brain rewards pleasurable experiences by increasing levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Learning how to enjoy the process of exercise could elevate levels of these transmitters so that exercise becomes a positive and rewarding experience. The result is that the more you exercise, the better you will feel, which could lead to long-term behavior change and a healthier life.
      h is essential for making it a daily habit.
      Treat yourself. Give yourself a small reward after completing a workout, doing all of the workouts you scheduled for yourself in a week or when you hit a goal. No, this does not mean breaking the bank or enjoying a meal with three times as many calories as you just burned off, but it does require a little planning to have the right reward ready. Give yourself permission to purchase a new piece of exercise clothing or a formal work outfit, enjoy a treatment at a spa or invest in new headphones for your workouts. Whatever it is, treating yourself to a reward activates the pleasure centers in your brain, which helps to establish a positive outlook toward the role that exercise plays in your life. 
      Schedule your workouts. If you live by your appointment calendar, it may sometimes feel as though your schedule takes over your life and limits the amount of time available for a workout. However, if you take the time to plan your schedule and include time for exercise, it is more likely to become a regular habit. Take a few minutes over the weekend to plan when and where you will exercise and put it in your schedule. Then, if someone tries to make demands for your time, you can say, “Sorry, but I’ve already got plans.”  
      Set a learning goal. There are two primary types of goals: outcome and learning. Outcome goals focus on the end result of performing a task, such as completing a marathon. Learning goals, however, focus on the process or steps required to achieve an outcome, such as learning how to exercise with a kettlebell. Focusing on the process of learning a new exercise technique or format could help release more dopamine, which is released in response to positive learning experiences, so that your brain associates exercise with pleasure.    
      Change your mindset. Refocus your outcome goals to focus on quality of life rather than trying to achieve some media-defined appearance. Instead of focusing on using exercise to change how you look, think of exercise as a means for improving your health and enhancing your quality of life. If you shift your focus toward using exercise as a means for achieving and maintaining better health, you might be surprised at how motivated you will become to maintain a more consistent workout schedule.    
      Develop a journaling practice. Use a journal to track your progress and record how you feel after you exercise. This doesn’t require lugging a journal with you to the gym for every workout—you could simply use the notes app on your phone to record a few brief statements about how the workout made you feel. Did you feel a sense of accomplishment? Were you able to do an exercise or complete a certain distance for the first time? Did you try a new class and enjoy the experience? Writing down the positive aspects of each exercise session and how it makes you feel could help you to shift your mindset so that you focus on the process, not necessarily the outcome.
      Find a workout buddy. Taking the steps to initiate behavior change by yourself can be tough, so having a friend along with you for the journey could help make the process a little easier. Enlisting a friend or family member to be a workout partner can give you someone to exercise with, which helps the time pass more quickly. It also makes you and your partner accountable to each other, which means you’re less likely to skip your workout if you know someone is counting on you. If you and a workout partner commit to exercising together, chances are greater that you will enjoy the experience, which is essential for establishing a long-term habit.
      Taking these steps to focus on the positive aspects of working out could help change your perception of the benefits of exercise so that it becomes easier to make it a consistent habit. It is only when exercise becomes a regular habit that you will experience lasting and long-term results from your efforts."

    title: 'How to Stick to a Diet: 7 Tips That Make Dieting Easier',
    readtime: '8-10 min',
    by: 'Jonathan Ross',
    image: 'https://images.news.iu.edu/dams/vrxvlfxuzj_w768.jpg',
    content: "Even though the literal meaning of the word diet is “way of eating or lifestyle,” it is now generally associated with something extreme that includes both a starting and a stopping point. Getting back to thinking of a diet as a “way of eating” is not only more accurate but more helpful and sustainable.
    The following tips are designed to help you stay positive (not perfect) and make progress (and not regress) in your “way of eating.”
    Enhance your desire for healthy food. Too many people believe that you can either enjoy tasty food that’s bad for you or resign yourself to eating unappealing food that is good for you. In reality, healthy food can be both delicious and extremely satisfying. Begin with foods you like that you know are healthy and then start seeking out similar healthy foods to try. Avoid forcing yourself to eat food you intensely dislike just because it is good for you. At the same time, reduce your exposure to over sweetened, oversalted, and over processed foods that train your tastebuds to think healthy food is boring.
    Make it harder to make unhealthy choices and easier to make healthy ones. Snacks are often appealing, not so much for their taste, but because they are available, and they are easy. And while it’s far easier to eat candy than peel an orange, the point is moot if the candy is not easily available. Keep it out of the house or put it in an inconvenient location in your kitchen, pantry, or some other far away part of your home. Improve your odds of eating healthfully by making healthy choices easier and unhealthy ones harder.
    Pick a limited number of your favorite treats and only indulge in those occasionally. While “everything in moderation” is a popular mantra, the concept of moderation is lost when we face countless opportunities to indulge every day. Indulging in moderation leads too many people to eat too many unhealthy foods too often, but only any single one infrequently. Instead, a better approach is to pick two or three treats you really love and enjoy them, on occasion, without guilt.
    Exercise is not punishment for the sins of eating. Exercise and healthy eating are not moral choices—they are simply healthful ones. Your eating habits and your exercise behaviors are meant to point you in the same direction rather than work against each other. The power of both physical activity and good nutrition together is greater than either one alone.
    Disrupt old habits and replace them with new ones. No, you don’t need more willpower—you need better habits, which can be viewed as behavioral shortcuts for your brain. These shortcuts develop around any behavior you repeat often. If you always have a bowl of ice cream while watching television at night, simply sitting down to watch a show at night can create the craving. Disrupt the habit by replacing it with healthier behavior. For example, you might brush your teeth before you sit down or eat a breath mint. Anything that disrupts and delays the automatic response (eat the ice cream) to the stimulus (sitting on the couch) can trigger your ability to consciously control your behavior rather than letting it be automatic.
    Avoid the extremists. Healthy eating is not flashy, trendy or weird. Drinking pickle juice or putting butter in your coffee, eating a lot of a single food or almost nothing at all (i.e., a “cleanse”), can be safely dismissed as folly. Sensible rarely makes headlines and it does not make good clickbait. Stay grounded by centering your eating plan on real food, consisting of plants, nuts, seeds and appropriate animal products that fit your lifestyle and preferences and are healthy for you. Anyone who believes that all humans should be omnivores or that all humans should be vegan is wrong. Like most areas of life, steer clear of extremists and you will find your way to nuance, truth and better health.
    Enjoy the meal and the people with whom you eat. A Mediterranean-Style dietary pattern is frequently recommended due to its focus on whole foods, but one part of it that is rarely mentioned is the Mediterranean approach to the experience of eating. It is focused on communing with others and enjoying food through all of the senses—the aromas, tastes, textures and appearance. Regardless of what we eat, there is much to be learned from this long-standing tradition of valuing the experience of eating and doing so with others.\ "

    title: 'How to Build Habits for Healthier Sleep',
    readtime: '10-12 min',
    by: 'Dr. Erin Nitschke',
    image: 'https://www.ideafit.com/files/Sleep%20Fitness.jpg',
    content:"When we are asked to reflect on or identify what “health” is or what it means to “be healthy,” that definition often involves body weight, body mass index (BMI), exercise and nutrition. In reality, “being healthy” might best be measured by joyful movements, balanced nutrition, stress management, social connectedness and—of critical importance—quality sleep. Sleep is essential for mental and physical health and is something we can’t afford to limitAccording to the American Sleep Association, sleep issues and sleepiness are a top health concern in our society. Statistics indicate that
    50-70 million American adults suffer from some type of sleep disorder
   9% of American adults reported falling asleep during the day (unintentionally)
   37% of 20- to 39-year-olds report short sleep duration, while 40% of 40- to 59-year-olds report short sleep duration
   3% of adults report less than 7 hours of sleep during a typical 24-hour period (even 30 minutes less than the minimum carries consequences)
   Adults need a minimum of seven to nine hours of sleep each night, yet more than one-third of the population does not get the minimum number of recommended hours.
   Consequences of Inadequate Quality Sleep 
   Inadequate sleep results in varied and full-body consequences. When sleep quality and duration are poor, individuals tend to have less energy, experience less self-regulatory control, develop an increased craving for sweet, salty, and starchy foods, and have higher levels of ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and lower levels of leptin (appetite-control hormone). Further, there’s a 50% higher risk for obesity if you get fewer than five hours of sleep each night. Other negative effects include immune system deficiencies, increased blood pressure, increased risk for heart disease, increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, irritability, forgetfulness and an inability to focus.
   In short, experiencing sleep deprivation and trying to work, live and function in a sleep-deprived state has significant consequences on long-term health. Sleep fitness and hygiene are just as important as physical fitness and health.
   “The statistics are real and necessary to wake us up to the importance of sleep,” says Beverly Hosford, author of Sleep Soundly, a five-week sleep program. “However, stressing about sleep can affect the timing and quality of sleep, so starting with stress reduction is often a great first step. What we do during the day impacts the night. Closing your eyes and noticing your breath right now can make a difference.”
   How to Build Better Sleep Habits
   Similar to developing physical fitness, sleep fitness takes effort and the implementation of small changes in daily behaviors to promote and support better sleep. Before change can occur, you have to raise your level of awareness, and the best place to begin is by examining and tracking your sleep habits throughout the week. Observe such things as:
   What you do before bed (read, watch TV, scroll social media, etc.)
   What time you turn the lights out
   What time you rise
   Caffeine and alcohol intake
   What time you eat dinner
   The temperature of your room
   The type of light you’re exposed to before bed
   Your energy levels throughout the day
   How many hours of sleep you think you get each night
   By journaling your observations, you are more likely to discover a pattern of behavior and make connections between the quality of your sleep and the behaviors you engage in. Once you have an idea of what your sleep ritual, routine, and contributing (or detracting) behaviors are, you can refine your habits to promote better quality and more restorative sleep.
   “Choose one habit that you are ready to change and journal or home in on it for a week,” urges Hosford. “Then, go to the next one that you can shift within your lifestyle. The best changes to make are the ones you are ready for.” 
   Make Small Changes
   No two people need the same things to sleep well; building habits for healthier sleep—such as regular physical activity and good nutrition—is highly personal and should be tailored to your needs and goals.
   Here are a few strategies to consider that will give your sleep experience a boost:
   Create a calming and consistent nighttime routine that allows for 30 minutes of “winding down” time. This means avoiding bringing your laptop or phone to bed (avoid exposure to screens and blue light in general). Dim the lights as bright lights can hinder melatonin production. Test methods of relaxation to see what works best—you might try reading, bedtime yoga, a hot bath, meditation or mindful breathing.
   Be physically active. Exercise has been shown to support improved sleep so commit to daily physical activity.
   Reduce alcohol consumption as it will disrupt sleep later in the night.
   Reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening. Caffeine is a natural stimulant and can keep you wired for hours after consumption.
   Avoid eating a large meal too close to bedtime, as doing so may cause discomfort.
   Create consistency in your bedtime and rising time. Make an effort to go to bed at the same time and rise at the same time. As tempting as it is to sleep in on the weekends or the days we have off from work, doing so will disrupt your sleep pattern.
   Try to be exposed to natural light early in the day. Sunlight helps to regulate the body’s natural circadian rhythm.
   Invest in a comfortable pillow and mattress that offers full-body support.
   Block out light and reduce screen time before bed. 
   Some find it easier to sleep with “white noise” such as a fan or portable machine.
   “Many people know what to change and just need support and reassurance around making those alterations,” explains Hosford. “Identify a friend, partner or support group (SleepFitness is one on Facebook) to encourage you as you incorporate new behaviors. This can make the journey smoother and more successful. Also, reframing the change to think about what you are adding in (bedtime routine, sound machine) instead of what you are taking away (TV, checking email) can fuel motivation and positive feelings.”
   Practicing sound and consistent sleep hygiene will not always resolve sleep concerns. If you experience chronic fatigue, consistently poor sleep or any physical ailments that may be related to lack of sleep, it’s important to seek the counsel of a sleep specialist and/or your primary care provider, as sleep disorders need specific attention to be resolved

    content: "The supplement industry is a multi-million-pound industry and there are lots of companies trying to persuade you that their product is the best one to take.
    I am often asked about taking supplements and, as everyone is unique, it’s not something I will answer with the exception of vitamin D throughout the winter months here in the UK. The NICE guidelines recommend that everyone in the UK should take Vitamin D supplements during the winter as it’s not possible to get enough from the sun. It is important to mention here though that you do need to get your levels checked first through a Nutritional Therapist or GP so that you know how much you should be taking. 
    Also, ideally we should be getting all the nutrition from food that we need by eating a balanced diet based on whole foods to keep us healthy and, whilst it is not always possible, it is a very good starting point. Magnesium, a good example, is found in green leafy vegetables but due to modern day farming the soil is often depleted and therefore this is a mineral that people can commonly find themselves to be deficient in. Magnesium is an important mineral with over 300 biochemical reactions in the body from nerve, muscle and energy production through to regulating blood pressure and the metabolism of many other minerals.
    Supplements can be very effective at accelerating your improvements to your health from the outset and enhancing micro nutrient intake but, as the name suggests, they are supplements to be taken in addition to good sound nutrition. Taking supplements as a way of improving a poor diet is not something I would ever encourage.
    So, back to this multi-million-pound industry. There are so many retail outlets and brands out there that often it is hard to know what to choose when looking for a supplement without the help of a Nutritional Therapist. High street shops will often stock supplements which contain excipients such as magnesium stearate, fillers, binders, artificial ingredients. They can have low therapeutic dosages so in fact can often not do the job you are led to believe.
    Caution needs to be taken when taking supplements as they can interact with medication causing side effects and it is possible to cause toxicity of nutrients if you don’t take the correct dosages. Also, some medications deplete the body of nutrients, so it is a good idea to get some advice if you are taking supplements in order to keep you in good health. If you don’t seek advice on supplementation it may be that you are not addressing the underlying health issues and may be taking the wrong product, at the wrong time (some supplements are better with food, others away from meals) in the wrong form and an incorrect dosage.
    In clinic, the supplements that I recommend are reputable brands which ensure that clients take the appropriate therapeutic dose and in the most bioavailable form to achieve maximum absorption, assimilation and utilisation within the body.
    If you would like to know more about supplements or have a health concern and would benefit from a nutritional consultation then please do get in touch here.

    content:"I just passed my exam! Now what? 
    I run across posts and messages just like this nearly every day from health and exercise professionals who have enthusiasm, knowledge and passion but are a little unsure of where to put all their energy. 
    Here is a glance at a few steps you can take to explore the industry and find your place:
    Define your Who, What and Why
    The number-one mistake I see new professionals making (and even veteran pros looking for their next opportunity) is not taking the time to clarify what it is they are trying to do and why they are attempting to make it happen. 
    Often, we enter the industry from a place of self-interest; we like to take classes, train or have a natural love for all things health and wellness. We’ve seen how other pros package their offerings: who they serve, what they deliver and where they work. While this is a great place to begin, you must spend some time determining your target market and the number-one service you are interested in providing. While these two items may change over time, getting clear about who and what can help you explore opportunities, amass additional knowledge and experience to capitalize on the opportunities, and get moving in this business. 
    Your why is crucial. Other pros may have the same who and the same what, but your why is personally meaningful and may help set you apart from other professionals to get the job. Why did you choose this target market on which to focus your attention? Or, what made you choose the what? Clearly articulating the answer to these two questions provides the basis of your personal branding and helps you connect with those you hope to serve through both your marketing and your work.
    Explore Opportunities
    Armed with a clear who, what and why, you are now ready to explore what’s available. Do your research and think outside the box! Start with the obvious options, the ones you’ve interacted with or come across in the past. These might include teaching classes at a multipurpose health club or training at a recreation center. Just be sure to dive a little deeper and see if there are other places worth investigating. 
    Here are a few blogs that break down current opportunities worth exploring for personal training (working for someone else or working for yourself), group fitness and health coaching. As you review these opportunities, resist the urge to “shapeshift.” In other words, instead of seeing a job posting and saying, “Oh, I could do that,” start with your who, what and why to ensure the opportunity will allow you to be at the intersection of purpose and profit. 
    Even if the opportunity seems a little outside your reach, throw your name in the ring. Learn more about the expectations and experience required. Add this to your ongoing “to-do” list so you can start planning now for the continuing education you’ll need to grow into your chosen career path as a health and exercise professional.
    Dive In 
    The best thing to do is dive in and get to work. Even if you haven’t yet landed a job or fully defined the business you’d like to launch, you still need to take some steps to get moving in the right direction. Here are a few things you can do to start gaining momentum in your career: 
    Recruit and Rehearse: Find a few family members, friends and acquaintances to be your guinea pigs. Try to select people who would be part of your target market. Practice your classes or sessions and ask for feedback. Not only will this help you gain experience and fine-tune your skills, but it will reaffirm your who, what and why. Adjust as necessary.
     
    Read and Research: Just because your exam studying days are behind you doesn’t mean it's time to put the books away. Now that you know who you’d like to work with, the services you want to provide and what’s needed to take advantage of the opportunities you find most appealing, it’s time to better understand where you need to go deeper in your knowledge. Identify books, formal and informal courses, specialty certificates and websites that are relevant and make a plan to learn a little more every day. This will not only add to your credibility (and confidence!), but it will also keep you motivated in your quest for finding the perfect path.
     
    Reach Out and Round-up: Finally, find communities and mentors with which to connect. In-person and online communities can be a great place to socialize ideas, find opportunities or gain insight into your chosen profession. You’ll find several online, especially on social media platforms such as the ACE Group Fitcommunity and the ACE Health Coach Network. Mentors may be a little tougher to come by but finding a veteran pro who has blazed a trail before you can be extremely beneficial. Whether offering you an insider's peek at what the job is really like, pointing you in the right direction for continuing education or additional information to prepare you for the role, or even giving you feedback on your work, collaborating with colleagues is often the best method to finding your way."

    title: 'WALKING FOR MEDITATION :- How to begin a mindful walking practice.',

    by: 'JULIE BENSMAN and REEBOK EDITORIAL',
    image: 'https://brand.assets.reebok.com/f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/capi/reebok_enUS/meditation1_274-672810.jpg',
    content:"During a year in which gyms were closed and fitness studios were shuttered, many of us turned to good old walking to get our exercise in. Not only does walking provide a welcome break in the day (during a time when every day is the same), it’s also a low-impact exercise that requires no special equipment. 
    The number of health benefits associated with walking is too long to list, but some of the highlights include better, sugar control, boosting creativity and enhanced brain function, as well as increased immunity, better moods and stress relief. But one benefit of walking that often gets overlooked is that it’s one of the easiest ways to meditate. A walking meditation is a great way to increase mindfulness, so if you think the only way to meditate is sitting quietly in a dark room, it’s time to think again. 
    A moving meditation (like walking) is often more accessible and just as beneficial as other forms of meditation. One of the best parts of mindful walking is that it doesn’t take up much time. Walking just ten minutes daily for at least a week can provide major results. Plus, evidence suggests that mindfulness increases the more you practice walking for meditation. 
    
   “So much of our lives are seated,” says Judy Heller, personal trainer and founder of Wonders of walking. “When you’re walking, the mind quiets. Endorphins are released, which reduces anxiety. These ‘feel-good’ chemicals lead to honoring the habit. Even if your mind wanders, you’re still placing one foot in front of the other.”
    
    
   PROPER FORM IS KEY
   It’s easy to assume you already know how to walk, but walking for meditation requires a bit more thought. Heller says you want to walk tall with your shoulders relaxed, letting your arms swing gently from your shoulders. Think about making your movements fluid by gently planting the heel of your shoe, rolling through your toes and gliding over the surface.
   “Any physical activity, even one as gentle as walking, can lead to injury through misalignment or overuse,” says breath coach and founder of Story and Spirit Michael Kass. “Listen to your body. If your knee starts to hurt or your lower back feels stiff, it’s fine to pause and see what may want to shift. There’s no need to power through pain.” Kass also recommends stretching before walking, especially if you spend the bulk of your time sitting at a computer. Gently stretching the hamstrings, calves and quadriceps can make a huge difference in preventing strain and injuries.
    “What matters most is cultivating trust within ourselves to notice things the body may be doing from conditioned patterning that is causing us harm,” says mindfulness teacher and founder of Walk the middle way Dave Trachtenberg. “For instance, maybe we’ve walked a certain way for years, but mindfulness starts helping us notice that our shoulders are very hunched, or the leg tightens up in a certain way. We can relax these parts of the body. Mindfulness trains us to feel our body’s innate signals of healing and pain more closely, so we can start to notice certain more subtle signs of injury to correct form before they become more serious.” 
   One of the main differences between a seated meditation and a walking/moving meditation is that how you move is how you focus. “A seated meditation tends to invite a more introspective approach,” says Kass. “A moving meditation brings the body more directly into the practice. For example, we can focus on becoming present with how our weight shifts as we walk or how our spine is aligned as we move through space.”
    It’s interesting to note that just because someone is an athlete, doesn’t mean a moving meditation will resonate more with them. The converse is true, as well: “I’ve worked with people who are largely sedentary who really love gentle movement work to help them reconnect with their bodies,” says Kass.
    
   JUST BREATHE
   When you’re walking to meditate, breath is just as important as form (some may say they’re one and the same). Walking to meditate isn’t a fitness walk. Your goal is to increase mindfulness, which is best achieved by focusing on breath.
    “No matter which body position we are in, the practice itself is the same: opening our awareness to something in the present by using an anchor like breath,” says Trachtenberg. “When we practice mindful walking, we are bringing an intention to tune into our breathing and body sensations. This helps us notice the habits of our mind, welcome and accept them, and then bring our awareness back to our body, breath and the space around us.”
    If you’re ready to begin walking for meditation, understanding the how and where can be overwhelming. But Trachtenberg says there’s no ideal length, speed or time of day to practice mindful walking. “Sometimes we overcomplicate things by trying to find a ‘right way’ to do them,” he says. “If someone wants to practice their awareness in a quiet nature setting without people, or in a crowded park with bicyclists and runners, both are very possible. It’s just a matter of preference. I’d even recommend trying both so you can cultivate your mindful awareness in both serene and noisy environments.”
    From a timing perspective, it’s better to focus on quality rather than quantity. “While it’s true practicing longer helps us cultivate awareness of our mind and emotions more over time,” says Trachtenberg, “it’s better to treat our meditation practice as a runner would prepare for a marathon: start small and slow until that’s consistent, then ramp up from there. Trust yourself to find the right balance between complacency and challenge.”
     
   AVOIDING COMMON MISTAKES
   The enemy of mindfulness is multitasking. So when you’re practicing mindful walking, don’t try to crank through a podcast or check your email incessantly. Kass says that even bringing your phone along (even if you don’t physically check it) can prevent you from being fully present because in many ways, our minds are always tending to our phones.  It’s been mentioned before but it bears repeating: there’s a difference between walking for exercise and walking for meditation. “The former tends to emphasize speed, distance and effort,” says Kass, “while the latter focuses on building conscious awareness. While they’re not mutually exclusive (you can definitely walk fast and far while cultivating awareness), it’s powerful to decide which you’d like to prioritize before setting out.”
   Trachtenberg says finding a balance between intention (purposefully opening our awareness, rather than letting our awareness be totally idle) and letting go (not being overly concerned with results, or trying too hard to focus) is a dance that’s always key to a mindfulness practice. Our instinct is often to ask, “How hard am I trying?” but sometimes it’s more important to know when to let go, to allow our focus to be softer and more open.

    content:"When Kelly Caizzo considers signing up for a running race, she looks for the same factors that most runners do—distance, size, time of year and location. But Caizzo, a 37-year-old stay-at-home parent from Maine, also prioritizes another issue: how well the race treats the environment. 
    As runners and society as a whole put more emphasis on sustainable practices, race directors are taking note and making an effort to keep Mother Earth in mind when they oversee a race. For runners like Caizzo, that’s important. “I try to make eco-friendly choices,” she says. “It has definitely impacted which races I run.”
    If you like to run and feel as Caizzo does, there are a growing number of race options for you. If you’re not sure where an event stands on its environmental policies, these pointers can help.
   WHERE TO START
   The trail racing community has traditionally been ahead of the curve on environmental efforts associated with events. Partly due to a growing cultural shift and partly due to the natural spaces where trail races are held, runners have generally high expectations of these events with regard to the environment. They look for things like collapsible/reusable cups, no race swag or the option to opt out of it and things like composting and recycling. 
   Road races, by comparison, can involve elements that don’t necessarily leave a small carbon footprint. Big expos, large swag bags, flyers, water stations with plastic cups and other less-than-environment-friendly features have long been hallmarks of road races. 
   Since 2007, however, the Council for Responsible Sport (CRS) has served as an education arm to the industry and also one that incentivizes race directors to be certified for environmental friendliness (determined by independent third-party evaluators). There are four levels of certification and runners on the hunt for environmentally friendly events can see clearly where a given event stacks up. 
   Shelley Villalobos, the managing director of CRS, says that the organization has certified about 175 races to date. “We’re seeing the demand start to bubble up,” she says. “In recent years, in particular, runners are moving toward experiences that keep the environment in mind. It’s encouraging.” 
    
    WHAT TO LOOK FOR
   There are several key measures runners can use when weighing where to lace up and spend their racing dollars, says Villalobos. The easiest place to start is checking to see if the event has the CRS certification. Also look to see if a race claims to be environmentally aware on its website or social media. “If so, does the event back up its claims with detail about what that means in action?” she asks. “If they are certified by us, we have 61 recommended actions for how a race director produces an event.”  
   For instance, does a race offer an option to neutralize the climate impact required to travel to the event? Look for this on the registration website. “At checkout, it will ask if you’d like to contribute a small amount to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from your travel,” explains Villalobos. “The funds are used to purchase carbon offsets with a chosen provider, who will apply it in some fashion like renewable energy development.” 
   Other important considerations include the race shirt associated with the event. While a popular souvenir for many participants, how the shirt is made and what it’s made of matter. Responsible race directors might offer a recycled polyester or cotton shirt. Others might offer an “opt out” option at registration for a lower entry fee.
    Another big step an environmentally conscious race organizer can take is eliminating single-use plastic water bottle or cups. Instead, you’ll bring your own bottle and fill up at coolers with multiple spigots on the course. Others might use compostable cups and ensure they are added to composting bins after the race. “I bring my own water belt, which not only helps the environment, but saves time on the course,” says Caizzo. (Don’t skip the hydration altogether, though: Even in cooler weather, it is important to drink enough fluids.)
    As for large distance races where some runners toss “throwaway” clothing at the start line, it’s worth asking the race director if they donate the clothing to local shelters, as well as any leftover food from the post-race activities.
    
   HOW YOU CAN HELP
   Along with the races you’ll find listed on the CRS website, there are other green-minded events in the U.S. and Canada to consider. The Canmore Rocky Mountain Half-Marathon, 10K, and 5K offers waste-free zones at the start and finish lines, meaning everything must be reused or recycled after the race. Some years, proceeds go to an environmental cause. The Hartford Marathon features a 40-foot-long water fountain at the finish, allowing runners to drink together without the need for individual plastic bottles. It also composts all race-day food scraps. And the J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge Series donates its proceeds to many of the public parks and conservancies that host its races.  
   If more sustainable racing is something you’d like to support as a frequent racer, speak to race directors. “I email race directors ahead of time to let them know I don’t want a swag bag, for instance,” says Caizzo. “Every time you reach out to event organizers, it plants a seed that sustainable practices are important to their participants.”  
   Villalobos agrees. “If race directors don’t hear from runners, how will they know you care?” she asks. “You can even organize letter-writing campaigns in your club or running community.” 
   Also consider racing closer to home to cut down on emissions used for travel. “Where I live, there are so many beautiful and fun race options,” says Caizzo. “I don’t have to go far for a good experience.”
   As the pandemic ends and racing resumes, some of the old practices—like big bins full of bagels post-race—will inevitably go by the wayside. Watch for how race directors handle this. Individual packaged foods, for instance, are not a green swap out. You’ll likely find opportunities to speak up and help organizers with better options.
    At the end of the day, remember that you have a role to play and a voice to be heard. “Smart race directors are listening to their participants,” says Villalobos. So use your voice for a greener future."

    title: '6 EASY WAYS TO MAKE FITNESS MORE SUSTAINABLE - You don’t need to go to extremes to save the world: Do your small part by starting with these easy steps that will make your exercise and eating habits more sustainable.',
    readtime: '10-15 min',
    by: 'GREG PRESTO and REEBOK CONTRIBUTOR',
    image: 'https://brand.assets.reebok.com/f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/capi/reebok_enUS/sustainability-hero_274-668129.png',
    content:"Living a more sustainable life is a lot like having a sustainable exercise routine. The big, challenging workouts are fun and fulfilling, but those once-in-a-while, monster exercise sessions aren’t what drive results. It’s the little things you do consistently that stack up to create big changes. Do the basics every day, and over time you’ll reap major fitness gains. 
    The same goes for living sustainably. Doing something huge, like reducing your daily trash to zero, making meals entirely from locally sourced, organically grown food or running 70 miles instead of commuting by car sounds awesome. But if you do it for just one day and never again, you won’t create results. Small acts of sustainability that you can stick with are the ones that can change the world for the better. For example: Replacing one meat-heavy meal with a vegetarian dinner each week has the same positive environmental impact as switching from a sedan to a hybrid, according to a University of Chicago study. Surprised? Check out these other smart strategies for making your life more sustainable, starting with your fitness routine.
    
   POWDER UP
   Finding a reusable BPA-free water bottle that you love is a simple way to make your workout Earth-friendly, but some sweat sessions need more than water. After or during a long run or ride, you need electrolytes and carbohydrates to refuel, too. 
   The U.S. uses 198 pounds of plastic bottles per second (let that sink in), and less than 30 percent of those bottles are recycled, according to a report by the National Association for PET Container Resources. To be more sustainable and still get your fruit punch fix, switch to an electrolyte powder. Instead of being shipped pre-mixed with water in a plastic bottle, these powders come in a multi-serving canister that’s usually made of cardboard. One canister can make 60 bottles’ worth of sports drinks, poured into your reusable bottle. There’s a sustainability bonus for your wallet, too: The powders cost a fraction of what the pre-mixed bottles do.
    
   WEAR SUSTAINABLE SHOES
   As much as 85 percent of textiles end up in landfills, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. And when those items are made using petroleum, they’ll sit in the dirt basically forever.
    So when you need a fresh pair of shoes, choose something sustainable: These Zig Dynamica shoes offer bold styling and all-day comfort from next-level cushioning, and the upper is made from recycled or reused materials so it reduces your overall footprint. Another option: plant-based performance running shoes. They’re crafted from eucalyptus, castor beans and natural rubber, making them as light on their carbon footprint as they feel on your feet. 
   GO LOCAL
   We live in amazing times, thanks to scientific breakthroughs and global logistics that allow stores to provide pretty much any food you want, any time of year. But in order to have strawberries and oranges year-round, those foods have to travel a long way to your plate, and that uses fuel and gives off greenhouse gases.
   Switching to a diet composed of foods produced near your home is the carbon equivalent of taking a whole month off from driving each year, according to research from Carnegie Mellon University and the Environmental Protection Agency. And eating local sustains your hometown economy in addition to the environment.
    
   MAKE IT MEATLESS
   According to Johns Hopkins University, if everyone on Earth switched one meat meal per week for a meatless one, the carbon footprint impact would be the same as taking 273 million cars off the road. The good news is that lots of people are already on board: Twenty-three percent of Americans reported eating less meat in 2020 than they consumed in 2019, according to a survey by Gallup. To go meatless without sacrificing protein, swap a beef burger for a plant-based one, order your salad with black beans instead of chicken or try one of these vegan breakfast options.
    
   TRAVEL BY FOOT
   Cars keep getting more efficient, but they’ll never catch up with the awesome power of your body: Chow down on a bowl of oatmeal, lace up your running shoes, and you can go for hours without refueling. 
    You may not be able to trade in your commute for a human-powered alternative every day. But you can give your car a rest once per month and explore the area near your home in a whole new way. Choose an excursion, like a trip to a local restaurant, a visit to a nearby friend or shopping at the farmer’s market, and plan to get there and back with the most sustainable tool you’ve got: your body.
    RECYCLE OLD FITNESS ITEMS
   Wearing the latest watch or arm-strap can push your workout performance (and, let’s be honest, your style) to new heights, arming you with the technology to track your recovery levels, log your mileage, and even monitor your metabolism.
   But keeping up with the latest tech means the old stuff piles up. In fact, 50 million tons of old electronics are tossed each year, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. Those used phones, TVs and yes, fitness watches, don’t just pile up plastic in landfills: They include rare and precious metals and other materials—as many as 57 chemical elements in each item, some of which are harmful to the environment. 
   The better way: Many big box electronics stores where you’ll be going to shop for a new gadget offer drop-off recycling for phones, computers and old electronic watches. Or you can find a place to properly recycle your dusty step-tracker at the EPA website. 
   Together, these smart strategies add up to some real change in the world. You don’t have to upend everything. Small adjustments can lead to big drops in your carbon footprint and help make your life more sustainable until you’re ready to build that off-the-grid tiny house

    content: "It’s been said that veganism is the way of the future, and anecdotally, the number of athletes turning to a vegan diet is growing worldwide. With that growth comes an increased curiosity among exercise enthusiasts about what a vegan athlete lifestyle may entail. An obvious starting point: Learning how to create vegan meals that meet all necessary nutrition requirements for athletes, without feeling locked into a limited range of food options. The perfect solution to this is to master the 80/20 formula, wherein you aim to eat 80 percent of your meals as vegan, and cut yourself some slack for non-vegan meals the other 20 percent of the time. 
    Here’s the truth that many people not familiar with vegan eating miss: Veganism is not some weird, obscure diet. Any meal can be made vegan, whether it’s an on-the-go lunch before a workout or a celebratory dish post-race. These are the fundamentals to creating nutrient-rich vegan meals:
   • Base: Grains, pasta and proteins create a solid foundation.
   • Layer: Broccoli, beans, peppers, onion, other vegetables and seasonings add flavor.
   • Topping: Nuts, seeds, condiments, fruit and more dress up any dish.
    
   It’s that simple. Everything from bowls, overnight oats, pizza, pasta dishes, salads, sandwiches, wraps and smoothies can be made using this formula. Curious? Get started by planning your next breakfast with the following dairy-free, plant-based recipes. 
    
   VEGAN CHICKPEA OMELET WITH CASHEW HOLLANDAISE (SERVES 2) 
   This recipe comes from Julia Murray, a former elite athlete and registered holistic nutritionist. A vegan for six years, Murray knows that many athletes worry about getting enough protein on a plant-based diet. “This is one of the most common questions I get,” says Murray, who created an 80/20 Plants app to help coach people who want to go vegan. “Protein is easier to get through a plant-based diet than people realize—every plant has protein, and as long as you’re eating enough calories and enough variety, you will easily attain your protein requirement.” 
   If you’re training hard and aiming to build muscle, says Murray, focus on the higher-protein foods like legumes, tempeh, tofu and seeds. This delicious omelet is made using chickpea flour which is packed with protein. 
   Filling:
   • 2 cloves garlic
   • Choice of veggies diced (mushrooms, peppers, spinach, red onion)
   • Flax oil
   • Vegan cheese (suggestions - Chao, Black Sheep, Gusta, Violife, Daiya or Miyokos)
   • Avocado slices
    
   Omelet shell:
   • 1½ cups (350g) firm tofu, patted with paper towel to remove excess liquid
   • ⅓ cup chickpea flour
   • ½ cup unflavored plant milk
   • 2 tbsp tapioca flour
   • 1 tsp garlic powder
   • 1 tsp onion powder
   • ½ tsp turmeric
   • ½ tsp black salt
   • ¼ cup nutritional yeast
   • Dash of pepper
   • 1 tsp of vegan butter for oiling the pan
    
   Hollandaise Sauce:
   • ¾ cup cashews, soaked overnight (or 10 minutes in hot water), then strained
   • ¼ cup lemon juice (juice of 1½ lemons)
   • ½ cup unsweetened, unflavored plant milk (almond, coconut or soy)
   • ½ tsp garlic powder
   • 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
   • 1 tsp turmeric powder
   • ¼ tsp sea salt
    
   Directions:
   Sauté garlic and veggies in flax oil. Set aside.
   Blend all omelet shell ingredients (not filling) in your blender until smooth.
   Test the texture: Dip a spatula in the mixture. If the mixture stays on the spatula, but is on the verge of dripping, that’s perfect.
   Turn a pan to medium heat and add the vegan butter.
   Pour half the mixture onto the oiled pan and set timer for 2 minutes, 30 seconds. Do not touch.
   When the timer goes off the omelet should be darkening on the top, maybe with a few bubble holes. Cover with half of your fillings. Fold one side over to create your vegan omelet. Place lid on the pan and let cook for a minute to melt the cheese.
   Make Hollandaise: Blend all sauce ingredients until smooth!
   Serve with avocado slices and a good drizzle of hollandaise sauce. 
    
    
    
   OVERNIGHT BUCKWHEAT OATS
   This easy breakfast recipe from Murray is packed with fiber and nutrients and can be made every few nights to get you through your early-morning workout. Feel free to be generous with the toppings. For even more vegetables in your diet, you can replace the buckwheat oats with 1 cup grated zucchini. Additionally, if you’re a fan of carrot cake, you can replace the buckwheat with 1 cup grated carrots.  
    
   Ingredients:
   • 2 cups oats
   • 3/4 cup buckwheat oats
   • 1/2-1 cup frozen blueberries
   • 1/4 cup walnuts
   • 1/2 tsp salt
   • 2 tsp maple syrup
   • 1tbsp cinnamon
   • 2 tbsp chia seeds
   • 1/4 cup goji berries (or raisins)
   • 2 cups plant milk 
   • 1 tsp matcha powder or cacao powder (optional)
   • Chopped dates (optional)
   • Coconut yogurt (topping)
   • Chopped strawberries and bananas (topping)
    
   Directions:
   Mix all ingredients except toppings together in a large bowl.
   Let soak for 15 minutes or overnight in the fridge
   In the morning, add your toppings and enjoy.
   Give these vegan recipes a try to start your day and see how you feel. If you find you have more energy for your workouts and less of a mid-day crash, you might consider adding vegan dishes for lunch and dinner, too. (You can find plenty online or on Murray’s 80/20 Plants app.) And if you decide veganism isn’t for you, that’s okay, too: There are still plenty of other ways to fuel your next workout."

    title: 'HOW DOES NON-DAIRY AFFECT YOUR WORKOUT? - When you cut out cow’s milk, consider this.',
    readtime: '7-8 min',
    by: 'JULIE BENSMAN and REEBOK EDITORIAL',
    image: 'https://www.bruker.com/en/applications/food-analysis-and-agriculture/food-quality/milk-and-diary/_jcr_content/root/herostage/backgroundImageVPL.coreimg.82.1920.jpeg/1596451146895/milk-dairy.jpeg',
    content: "Almond, macadamia, oat, soy, flax, rice, coconut. The list of plant-based milks goes on and on. Sales of alternative milks were up eight percent last year, hitting $1.7 billion in sales. So why are so many people cutting out dairy? 
    Well, if you’re lactose intolerant, drinking cow’s milk can be pretty grim. Symptoms include nausea, cramps, bloating, gas and diarrhea. But even if you’re not lactose intolerant, dairy could be the trigger behind skin issues and even your chronic bad mood. 
    Before you decide to cut out dairy entirely, it’s important to consider the nutritional toll it might take on your workout. Here’s what to consider when canceling milk.
    
   FIGURE OUT YOUR WHY
   Not everyone is lactose intolerant but according to a study by the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, many more of us are than we might have realized. Some 30 million to 50 million Americans can’t handle lactose, including up to 75 percent of African Americans and American Indians and 90 percent of Asian Americans. 
    
   “I was dealing with some health issues a few years ago and my doctor recommended I go on an autoimmune protocol, which included eliminating dairy,” says Brittany Fuisz, founder of Malibu Mylk, an organic flax milk company. “Within a week, I noticed a decrease in my body’s inflammation and much clearer skin. And I was just generally in a better mood.”
   “Cutting out dairy can make a huge difference in how you feel,” says Stephanie Middleberg, Registered Dietitian and author of The Big Book of Organic Baby Food and The Big Book of Organic Toddler Food. “People go dairy-free to address gastrointestinal issues like IBS, skin problems like eczema and autoimmune conditions like celiac, but they also might be conscious of environmental reasons.”
   A 2018 University of Oxford study found that a glass of cow’s milk resulted in almost three times more greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based milks. Even worse? It used nine times more land than any of the milk alternatives. 
   Whatever your reason, it doesn’t hurt to just try cutting out dairy (obviously, you can add it back in whenever you want). Middleberg says she often recommends eliminating dairy for her patients. “Anytime someone comes in with digestive or skin issues, or even an inflammatory condition, I just want to see what cutting dairy does for them,” she says.
    
   CHOOSE YOUR MILK
   So what’s the problem with cow’s milk and why is it worsening so many conditions? The answer might not come down to what so much as where. Much of the dairy in the U.S. is highly pasteurized. During that process, it loses the essential enzymes most people need to digest it. 
   One thing’s for sure: In the world of wellness, milk is a polarizing topic. “Dairy is nutrient-rich so if it agrees with you, definitely incorporate organic, grass-fed dairy into your diet,” Middleberg says. “Try kefir, cottage cheese, unsweetened yogurt, hard cheeses like Parmesan and cheddar and softer cheeses like goat cheese, feta and ricotta. On the flip side, if dairy doesn’t agree with you, it will be inflammatory, cause congestion and increase androgen hormones that can aggravate skin conditions.”
    Most people fall somewhere in the middle on the lactose-tolerance spectrum. That being said, if you’re ready to cut out dairy in favor of a plant-based milks, knowing where to start can be pretty overwhelming. A stroll down the dairy aisle of your fancy local grocery store will offer countless milk alternatives, not to mention yogurts, cheese and butter.
    
   “Of course, I’m biased, but flax milk is a great way to increase your fiber and omega-3 intake,” says Fuisz. “It has a nice, thick consistency, so it’s great in smoothies, coffee, cereal or even baked goods.”
    Middleberg says she love flax milk, too, which is also high in protein. Similarly high in protein? Pea milk. And although soy milk ranks high in protein, too, it’s usually a heavily-sprayed GMO crop, so she recommends skipping it.
    
   ADJUST YOUR DIET FOR OPTIMAL WORKOUTS
   Dairy isn’t crucial to an athlete’s performance, but protein is. So for those looking to keep up their fitness regimen but cut out cow’s milk, they’re going to want to supplement those essential amino acids, carbs and electrolytes. “Most plant-based milks are just watered-down versions of what they’re made from, with little nutrition,” says Middleberg. “I don’t recommend athletes turn to plant-based milks for a nutritional boost, but they can fortify other areas of their diet.”
   For calcium, try greens like kale, spinach, collards, sesame seeds, tahini and fatty fish like sardines, tuna and salmon. Calcium works best with ample supplies of Vitamin D, so pick up some eggs, fish and mushrooms (or take a Vitamin D supplement). 
   One of the biggest predictors of workout success is motivation, which dairy can also mess with. But, as is often the case with dairy, it’s complicated. Middleberg explains that dairy contains the protein casein, which contains casomorphins. Casomorphins are morphine-like compounds that attach to brain receptors, which may help explain why people love dairy so much. When we eat certain dairy products (like cheese!), a surge of dopamine is released.
   “Dairy is often a ‘feel-good’ food from a chemical standpoint but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it does our bodies good,” Middleberg says. “If dairy is leading to pain and inflammation in certain people, that can definitely lead to anxiety and depression. Being in chronic pain or discomfort can really dictate your mood especially when you don’t know what the cause is. And, of course, impact your workout.”
   So, here’s an idea: Cut out dairy and see how you feel. And then do you what makes you feel good. No matter where you decide to land on the topic, just make sure to keep on moving."

    title: 'THE RISKS OF OVERTRAINING- “Less is more” has never been so true. Read what the pros have to say about staying healthy when you love to go hard.',
    readtime: '7-8 min',
    by: 'DANIEL DOWLING and REEBOK CONTRIBUTOR',
    image: 'https://brand.assets.reebok.com/f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/capi/reebok_enUS/overtraining-hero_274-641658.jpg',
    content: " The “no days off” memes started as an innocent way of motivating people to achieve their fitness goals. But the truth, personal trainers say, is that passing on rest days too frequently can lead to overtraining syndrome, a serious condition that involves reduced athletic performance, lifting plateaus, weakness, fatigue, disturbed sleep and even injury.
    New Orleans-based certified personal trainer and health coach Amanda Capritto says that people often ignore signs of overtraining because of an increasingly hardcore fitness culture. “You might be feeling sore enough to call into work,” Capritto says. “But you’ll still lace up your kicks and hit the gym because that’s what the jacked dudes on Instagram do.” The way she sees it, pain and fatigue are often the last warning signs before burnout.
    The good news is that overtraining syndrome isn’t a forgone conclusion—even when you like to go hard, and go often. You can prevent it with a few simple steps—but first you have to learn how to spot it. These are some of the most common red flags.
     Easy workouts feel impossible. Last month you deadlifted 200 pounds for five reps. Today you can’t even pick up 200 pounds once. If you’re experiencing something like this, “your body is screaming at you to take a break,” says Capritto. “When easy loads begin to feel impossible, you’ve pushed your body past the point of productivity.” (This also applies to running and other forms of exercise.)
     
    You can’t sleep. Insomnia has many causes, including psychological stress and artificial light. Overtraining is another culprit. “When you work out too intensely too often,” Capritto says, “your adrenal hormones spike when you’re supposed to be calming down, which can preclude high-quality sleep.” 
    You can’t eat. Loss of appetite is a sign that your body is overworked. “If you’re exercising daily yet can’t stomach the thought of eggs and toast, something’s off,” Capritto says. “Your hunger hormones aren’t being properly regulated because your body is putting too much energy into simply staying awake and active.” 
    You’re irritable. Snappy, knee-jerk reactions normally might cause you to slip on your joggers and head to the gym to get it out of your system, but it could also mean it’s time for a rest day. “Irritability and mood swings are signs of hormone imbalances,” Capritto says. “These can occur when you push your body to its limits day after day.” 
    Your workouts feel lackluster. Instead of being fun, exercise begins to feel like an obligation. Says Capritto, “Fatigue and soreness are unlikely to keep athletes from working out, but there’s definitely a problem when you start resenting your normal routines.”
     You’re constantly sore. Muscle soreness is an inevitable part of fitness, and it doesn’t always indicate overtraining. But if you feel sore every day, or sore to the point of feeling weak, check in with yourself. You might benefit from a day or two away from the gym. 
    You keep getting sick. Decreased immunity occurs in the late stages of overtraining syndrome. At this point, the athlete will likely need to take several weeks away from intense exercise. “If you ignore the signs of overtraining to the point where your body is fighting to stay healthy, a single rest day won’t help,” Capritto says. 
     
    THE FALLOUT FROM OVERTRAINING
    If you reach the point of overtraining, you’ll start to experience diminished returns for your workout efforts—meaning you’ll do the same workout as usual, but find your reps, load or speed slipping, says Capritto. At the same time, if you keep upping the intensity of your sessions without allowing your body time to recover, your injury risk skyrockets. Stress fractures, tendinitis and bursitis are all common injuries that occur due to overtraining. 
     
    With all these setbacks, it’s not surprising if your love for fitness starts to wane. “The effects of overtraining aren’t just physical,” Capritto points out. “Many people who experience overtraining describe a declining enthusiasm for their sport.” 
     Because the early signs of overtraining syndrome are so broad, it’s often tough to pinpoint the cause of your fatigue and crankiness. The key is to monitor symptoms and look for correlations, Capritto says. For example, if you’ve been feeling irritable and tired but you PR your deadlift two weeks in a row, your symptoms likely aren’t stemming from too much training. On the other hand, if you’re having trouble falling asleep and you dread going to the gym, it might be time for a rest day. 
     
    STAYING ON THE HEALTHY SIDE
    It’s a fine line between going hard and getting injured—especially with so many fitness enthusiasts on social media chronicling their every squat. “You’re just going to have to ignore the pervasive hustle culture you see on your Instagram feed,” Capritto says. “Yes, you should work out hard often, but you don’t have to work out hard every day.” Establishing a routine with high-intensity days, low-intensity days and full-out rest days is key to avoiding overtraining syndrome, she says. 
    Make sure to include stretching, foam rolling and low-intensity aerobic exercise like walking in your routine as well: These all help your muscles recover from an intense workout. Sleep is also essential. “Sleep is a highly restorative process,” Capritto says, and without enough of it, your body can’t flush out toxins and repair tissue as effectively as it needs to. 
    Your perfect rest schedule will be unique to your needs, but in general, one to two rest days per week is perfect for high performers. Taking a complete week off two to four times per year can help reset your body after an intense training cycle, too. Yes, it’s tough for hardcore exercisers to step away, but a few days of self-imposed rest beats a month-long layoff for an overtraining injury every time. With a little R&R in your pocket, you’ll be ready to hit the ground running again.

    content:"Like many people, you may have limited access to gyms and not many options for workouts with partners unless you’re training with someone in your household. However, the outdoors has been shown to be a safer option for exercise given the natural air flow. These socially distanced workouts can easily be done in a park without any equipment and are ideal for those warmer springtime days. You can even invite your friends to join you for some added encouragement and support. (Just save the high fives and hugs for later when it’s safer.)
    Before you get started, warm up for at least three to five minutes by performing your favorite cardio movements or with a simple walk or jog outside. If you don’t have access to any cardio equipment, jog in place for one minute and complete two sets of the following:
    10 bodyweight squats (squat to a park bench)
    3-5 downward-facing dogs (hinging forward from the hips toward the ground while keeping your back neutral)
    3-5 dirty dogs on each side
    5 lunges with elbow instep per side
    The Circuit
    In this workout, you’ll perform each movement for maximum repetitions or distance in 30 seconds. When the 30 seconds ends, take 10-15 seconds of rest to transition to the next movement. Repeat until you have completed all seven movements.
    After each round (completion of all seven exercises), rest one to three minutes before continuing onto the next round.
    Bear Crawl (go for maximum distance and mix it up by going backwards at the 15-second mark to get back to the start)
    Alternate Leg Push-off (find a step, set of stairs or an elevated surface like a rock to perform this on)
    Push-ups (modify to a bent knee push-up like this one)
    Bicycle Crunches
    Elevated Glute Bridge (you don’t need any weights because body weight can be challenging enough)
    High Plank T-spine Rotation (modify to your knees)
    Walking Lunges (keep moving, you’re almost done with this round!)
    Rest one to three minutes before repeating this series for three to four rounds.
    Plyo Power
    This workout can be tacked on to the circuit above for an extra challenge or used as a cardio finisher to a strength workout of your choice. Be sure you are warmed up properly for this workout because it includes advanced movements that utilize more full-body power.
    For each movement, perform as many repetitions as possible for 15 seconds. When the 15 seconds is done, rest for 10-15 seconds and move on to the next movement. Go through this series of movements three to four times, depending on your fatigue level.
    Forward Linear Jumps
    Mountain Climbers
    Toe Taps (tap onto a stair, step or a stable rock)
    Jump and Reach
    Rest for at least one minute before repeating this series for another three to four rounds.
    With these workouts, aim to be as intense as possible during each movement because you have at least one minute of rest coming up between rounds. After you finish these workouts, be sure to bring your heart rate back down to a recovery range with some easy walking before you sit down to rest.
    One of the best things you can do for your overall health is to keep moving your body. So grab some friends (figuratively, not literally) and have them join you for this workout in the park."},
